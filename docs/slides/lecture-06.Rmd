# Removing the additive assumption

.font110[

* In our previous analyses of the Boston housing data, we assumed that the effect on median home value (`cmedv`) of increasing the average number of rooms per dwelling (`rm`) was independent of the percentage of lower status of the population (`lstat`)

* For example, the linear model $$E\left(cmedv\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 lstat + \beta_2 rm$$ states that the average effect on median home value of a one-unit increase in `rm` is always $\beta_2$, regardless of the percentage of lower status of the population

* By adding a *two-way interaction effect* between `rm` and `lstat`, we allow the effect of `rm` on `cmedv` to vary with `lstat` (and vice versa): $$E\left(cmedv\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 lstat + \beta_2 rm + 
\beta_3 lstat \times rm$$

# The model building problem 

.font125[

* "Conflicting" goals in regression model building ([*bias-variance tradeoff*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff)):

    - Want **as many (useful) predictors as possible** so that the "information content" in the features will influence $\widehat{Y}$ (**low bias**)   
    
    - Want **as few predictors as necessary** because $Var\left(\widehat{Y}\right)$ increases with the number of predictors (**low variance**)

* Need to find a compromise that leads to the "best" regression equation

# Over fitting

It is possible to "over tune" your models to maximize performance on the training data. Such models will not generalize well to new data. We call this process [*over fitting*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting):

# "Best" subsets

.font125[

* The most direct approach is called .bold[all subsets] or .bold[best subsets] regression: .purple[compute the least squares fit for all possible subsets and then choose between them based on some criterion that balances training error with model size.]

* It is often impossible to examine all possible models; for example, with 40 potential predictors, there are .bold[over a billion models!] Instead we often rely on automated approaches that search through a subset of them. We'll discuss a common approach called [stepwise regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression).

# Selecting an "optimal" model

.font125[

There are a number of criteria for helping to select an "optimal" member in the path of models produced by automatic search procedures, for example:

* Adjusted R-squared; $R_{adj}^2$ (.purple[larger is better])

* Mean square error; $MSE$ (.purple[smaller is better])

* Mallow's $C_p$ (.purple[smaller is better])

* *Akaike information criterion*; $AIC$ (.purple[smaller is better])

* *Bayesian information criterion*; $BIC$ (.purple[smaller is better])

* Prediction sum of squares; $PRESS$ (.purple[smaller is better])

# RMSE and $R_{adj}^2$

.font110[

$\begin{align} RMSE &= \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{\sum\left(Y_i - \widehat{Y}_i\right) / \left(n - p\right)} \\ R_{adj}^2 &= 1 - \left(\frac{n - 1}{n - p}\right)\frac{SSE}{SST} = 1 - \frac{MSE}{SST / \left(n - 1\right)} = 1 - \left(\frac{n - 1}{n - p}\right)\left(1 - R^2\right) \end{align}$

]

.font120[

* Both $RMSE$ and $R_{adj}^2$ take the number of coefficients, $p$, into account

* Unlike the ordinary $R^2$, $R_{adj}^2$ increases if and only if MSE decreases (or RMSE decreases)

* In my opinion, $R_{adj}^2$ is preferred since it is more interpretable by itself (e.g., as the fraction of variance in the response explained by the predictors in the current model)

]


---

# Information criterion

.font150[

General formula: $-2 \log\left(L\right) + kp$

]

.font120[

* $AIC \implies k = 2$ and $BIC \implies k = \ln\left(n\right)$ 

* For a fixed sample size $n$, the first term decreases as $p$, the number of coefficients, increases
    
* For a fixed sample size $n$, the second term increases with $p$
    
* The BIC penalizes large $p$ more than AIC whenever $n \ge 8$ (i.e., the BIC criterion tends to favor more *parsimonious* models); BIC is also sometimes referred to as the *Schwarz Bayesian criterion* (SBC)

* R has built-in functions called `AIC()`, `BIC()`, and `extractAIC()`

]


---

# Prediction sum of squares

.font120[

$PRESS = \sum_{i = 1}^n \left(Y_i - \widehat{Y}_{\left(i\right)}\right)^2 = \sum_{i = 1}^n e_{\left(i\right)}^2 = \sum_{i = 1}^n\left[e_i / \left(1 - h_i\right)\right]^2$

* Summarizes the prediction errors across all observations (similar to $SSE$)

* Models with "small" $PRESS$ statistics are considered good candidate models (in the sense that they have "small" prediction error)

* Equivalent to *leave on out cross-validation* (LOOCV)

* Can be computed at the cost of a single fit!

* R has no built-in `PRESS()` function, so we'll write our own!

# Some cautions

.font110[

* No variable selection technique guarantees to find the "best" regression equation for the data set of interest

* Different variable selection techniques may very well give different results (and they often do!)

* Complete reliance on the algorithm for results is to be avoided (.purple[Why?] `r emo::ji("thinking")`)

* Other valuable information such as experience with, and knowledge of the data and problem, should be utilized whenever possible!!

* Model selection techniques are high variance procedures; that is, models identified by stepwise methods have an inflated risk of capitalizing on chance features of the data and will not apply well to new data

* And many more...

# Modern alternatives

.font110[

* [Regularized regression](https://koalaverse.github.io/AnalyticsSummit18/03-Regularization.html#1); for example, the LASSO

  - Variable selection `r emo::ji("check")`

* Multivariate adaptive regression splines ([MARS](https://koalaverse.github.io/AnalyticsSummit18/04-MARS.html#1)) and tree-based methods (like Friedman's stochastic GBMs and random forests)

  - Variable selection `r emo::ji("check")`

  - Nonlinear relationships `r emo::ji("check")`
    
  - Variable interactions `r emo::ji("check")`
    
  - Variable importance `r emo::ji("check")`
